            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I know the difference a Labour government makes. Growing up in Corby, a town devastated by the closure of the steelworks, I saw how Labour rebuilt lives by investing in schools, reconnecting us with a long-awaited train station, giving families real hope. That opportunity meant I became the first in my family to go to university, where I served two terms as Students' Union President at the University of Greenwich, representing 30,000 students across the South East.</p>
            
            <p>Those same values of fairness and opportunity drive me now in Lewisham.</p>
            
            <p>In my career I've held senior partnerships roles, managing budgets, leading teams, and making tough decisions that deliver results. In the Party, I've been Chair of Ladywell Labour for three years and before that led campaigns in Lewisham Central.</p>
            
            <p>As Chair I've worked to strengthen Ladywell: arranging engaging meetings, reaching new members through personal phone calls and postcards, and hosting well-attended socials. This has created a vibrant branch with committed volunteers supporting essential campaign winning activities such as door-knocking and leafleting.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of work and the Party, I volunteer as a trustee with a Lewisham housing charity that provides homes for over twenty older residents.</p>
            
            <p>Standing to be your Crofton Park councillor is the natural next step, bringing together professional experience and grassroots commitment to campaigning and community service.</p>
            
            <h2>My commitment to you:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessible and accountable:</strong> I will be an active Crofton Park councillor. I will be visible, present, and responsive to both members and residents.</li>
                <li><strong>Focused on local priorities:</strong> I will build on the work of your outgoing councillors by improving road safety, tackling fly-tipping and street cleanliness, and working with police and council officers to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour.</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening our Party:</strong> I will work with Crofton Park members to build an active, welcoming branch. Stronger branches mean stronger councils.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>My commitment to the people of Lewisham:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Champion genuinely affordable homes for low-income families, while also pushing for home ownership accelerators and intermediate rent schemes so working families can build a future in Lewisham.</li>
                <li><strong>Cleaner, safer streets:</strong> Tackle fly-tipping head-on with stronger enforcement, better waste services, and community partnerships. Clean streets and pride in our borough are the basics we all deserve.</li>
                <li><strong>Fair funding for Lewisham:</strong> Lead the case for a fair deal from central government so we can preserve essential services, rebuild those that have been cut, and invest confidently in Lewisham's future.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What we achieve here in Crofton Park, from safer streets to stronger services, shows the difference Labour makes when it works closely with residents. I've shown I can organise, campaign, and strengthen our Party at the grassroots, and I want to bring that same determination to Crofton Park. With your support, I'll be a councillor who gets the basics right, stands up for residents, and helps strengthen Labour across Lewisham.</p>

            <p>I want to hear from you about Crofton Park's priorities, please contact me on: <strong><a href="tel:07746933682">07746 933682</a></strong> or <strong><a href="mailto:me@alexbrooks.uk">me@alexbrooks.uk</a></strong></p>
